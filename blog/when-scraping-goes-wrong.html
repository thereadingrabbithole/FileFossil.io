  <h1>ðŸ’¥ When Scraping Goes Wrong</h1>
  <p>Weâ€™ve all been there. You launch a scrape and 2 minutes later your IP is blocked, your ZIP file is empty, and somehow your laptop is crying.</p>

  <h2>Hereâ€™s what to avoid:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Scraping JavaScript-heavy sites with no fallback â€“ enjoy your 0 results.</li>
    <li>Ignoring robots.txt and getting throttled like a kid caught with a slingshot.</li>
    <li>Scraping private content without permission â€“ the legal version of playing Frogger on the M25.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How FileFossil helps:</h2>
  <p>Smart filters. Respectful scraping. Auto-retries. And when it still goes wrong? At least you can say it wasnâ€™t your fault. Probably.</p>

  <p><em>Mistakes were made. Letâ€™s just not make them twice.</em></p>
