  <h1>🕸️ How to Recover a Website from Archive.org</h1>
  <p>So your website’s gone AWOL. Great. All those witty blog posts, pictures of bread, and 3-year-old memes – vanished. Fear not, digital Indiana Jones – Archive.org’s Wayback Machine has your back (most of the time).</p>

  <h2>Step-by-step recovery guide</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://archive.org/web/">archive.org/web</a>.</li>
    <li>Paste the lost website URL. Breathe. Hit Enter.</li>
    <li>Select a snapshot. (Pro tip: Choose one before your site turned into a 404 party.)</li>
    <li>Use FileFossil.io to extract the good bits. Pages, images, documents, dignity...</li>
    <li>Export to ZIP. Celebrate like it’s 1999 – because frankly, it might be.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Why not just click “Save As”?</h2>
  <p>Because you’re not a caveman. Static saves miss assets, links break, styles vanish. FileFossil digs up all the bones and pieces them back together, Jurassic Park-style.</p>
