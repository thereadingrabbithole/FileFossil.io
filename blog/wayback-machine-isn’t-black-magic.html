  <h1>🧙 The Wayback Machine Isn’t Black Magic</h1>
  <p>You typed in a dead website and suddenly you’re back in 2006. Frogs had blogs. Flash was still a thing. You didn’t know how it worked – you just whispered, “sorcery” and clicked.</p>

  <h2>But here’s the deal:</h2>
  <p>The Wayback Machine stores snapshots of websites over time, based on crawls and user submissions. Some are complete. Some are as broken as your New Year’s resolution.</p>

  <h2>What it’s good for:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recovering lost websites</li>
    <li>Tracking changes to content or design</li>
    <li>Proving you <em>did</em> post that blog before they copied it</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where FileFossil comes in:</h2>
  <p>We extract every file, page, and image from a snapshot. No manual clicking, no swearing at 404s, no nonsense.</p>
