  <h1>ðŸ¤– Web Scraping vs Web Crawling</h1>
  <p>People toss these terms around like theyâ€™re interchangeable. Theyâ€™re not. Thatâ€™s like saying a stalker and a postman do the same job because they both follow you home.</p>

  <h2>Web Crawling:</h2>
  <p>Think Googlebot. It scans pages, notes links, builds indexes. Doesnâ€™t take stuff, just logs it. Like a digital hall monitor with a clipboard.</p>

  <h2>Web Scraping:</h2>
  <p>This is the one that gets the goods. Scrapers collect data from web pages â€” text, images, videos, and documents. Basically, itâ€™s how you saved that 2010 fanfic youâ€™ll never admit existed.</p>

  <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Crawlers <em>find</em> stuff. Scrapers <em>take</em> stuff.</p>
